# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this brief *Perspective* piece, we discuss the heterogeneity of depression, and the limited success of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to treatment. We explore a personalized medicine approach to psychiatry, which integrates brain circuitry, genetic and molecular markers, and individual clinical symptoms through machine learning approaches to ultimately improve treatment selection.
