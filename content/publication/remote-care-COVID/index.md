Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a shift from in-person to remote mental health care. While remote care methods have long existed, their widespread use is unprecedented. There is little research about mental health care user and provider experiences with this transition, and no published studies to date have compared satisfaction between these groups.

Methods: Canadian mental health care users (n = 332) and providers (n = 107) completed an online self-report survey from October 2020 to February 2021 hosted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression. Using a mixed-methods approach, participants were asked about their use of remote care, including satisfaction, barriers to use, helpful and unhelpful factors, and suggestions for improvement.

Results: Overall, 59% to 63% of health care users and 59% of health care providers were satisfied with remote care. Users reported the greatest satisfaction with the convenience of remote care, while providers were most satisfied with the speed of provision of care; all groups were least satisfied with therapeutic rapport. Health care providers were less satisfied with the user-friendliness of remote care (P < 0.001) than users, while health care users were less satisfied than providers with continuity of care (P < 0.001). The use of a video-based platform was associated with remote care satisfaction among health care users (P < 0.02), and qualitative responses support the importance of visual cues in maintaining therapeutic rapport remotely. The majority of users (55%) and providers (87%) reported a likelihood of using remote care after the pandemic.

Conclusions: Remote mental health care is generally accepted by both users and providers, and the majority would consider using remote care following the pandemic. Suggestions for improvement include greater use of video, increased attention to body language and eye contact, consistency with in-person care, as well as increased provider training and administrative support."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rapid shifts from in-person to remote mental health care, but little was known about how Canadians were experiencing this transition. This national online survey of 332 mental health care users and 107 mental health care providers through the CAN-BIND Program aimed to understand experiences of remote care during COVID-19, including what worked and what didn't. Overall, the majority of users (59-63%) and providers (63%) were satisfied with remote care. Users reported greatest satisfaction with the convenience of remote care, while providers were most satisfied with speed of provision of care; all groups were least satisfied with therapeutic rapport. Use of a video-based platform was significantly associated with remote care satisfaction. Most users (55%) and providers (87%) said they would likely use remote care again after COVID-19. Recommendations for improving future use of remote care are discussed.
