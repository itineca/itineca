On World Suicide Prevention Day 2021, we hosted the official launch of *What It Takes to Make It Through: Stories of Suicide Resilience and Loss*, a collection of personal stories about suicide published through the <a href="https://asrlife.ca/storybook" target="_blank">Storybook Project</a>. Supported by the Ontario Brain Institute, this free virtual book launch included a panel discussion and Q&A with several of the book’s authors.

The <a href="https://asrlife.ca/storybook" target="_blank">Storybook Project</a> is an outreach initiative of the Arthur Sommer Rotenberg (ASR) Suicide & Depression Studies Program at St. Michael’s Hospital. It aims to amplify the voices of those with personal experience with suicide, decrease stigma, and foster connection through storytelling. At the ASR, we put out a public call inviting people who have been touched by suicide through contemplation, attempt, or loss to share their unfiltered, personal journeys. We received dozens of powerful submissions from across Canada and have worked together with the authors to compile them into the printed collection, *What It Takes to Make It Through*.

The book is now available for purchase from the <a href="https://books.friesenpress.com/store/title/119734000115637966" target="_blank">publisher's website</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/What-Takes-Make-Through-Resilience/dp/1525566296/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1629822094&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/What-It-Takes-Make-It-Through-ASR-Suicide-Studies-Collective/9781525566295?ref=grid-view&qid=1629822237276&sr=1-2" target="_blank">Book Depository</a>, and <a href="https://www.cavershambooksellers.com/search/1525566296" target="_blank">Caversham Booksellers</a>.
