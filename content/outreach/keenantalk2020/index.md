As part of the Keenan Popular Science Lecture Series at St. Michael's Hospital, on February 13, 2020, I gave a public talk to a group of 50 high school students about suicide prevention. We covered major risk factors for suicide, and how to have a conversation with a loved one if you are concerned about them.
