title: Storybook Project
summary: Since 2016, I have helped to coordinate the Storybook Project, an ASR outreach initiative which shares the experiences of those touched by suicide, harnessing the power of storytelling to connect us and help us learn from one another. Book release is anticipated in mid-to-late 2020.
