I am a PhD Candidate with the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto, based at the ASR Suicide & Depression Studies Program at St. Michael's Hospital. My primary research project focuses on the association between concussion, depression & suicide risk using neuroimaging (fMRI). I have also been involved in studies of neurobiological markers of suicide risk, Emergency Department visits for suicidality, and various clinical trials of pharmacotherapy and neurostimulation for depression.

I am passionate about science communication and have experience teaching across diverse contexts &mdash; at the university level as a <a href="#teaching">Teaching Assistant</a>, in the lab as a mentor to junior students, in community settings with youth, and in a public capacity through mental health outreach and advocacy events. I have a strong interest in bridging the gap between academic and public spheres, and integrating the lived experience voice into the research process &mdash; making research a dynamic and collaborative endeavour that's responsive to the input and needs of the communities it serves.
