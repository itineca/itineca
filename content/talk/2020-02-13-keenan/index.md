summary: Public talk with high school students about risk factors for suicide, and how to have a conversation with a loved one if you're concerned about them.
abstract: "As part of the Keenan Popular Science Lecture Series at St. Michael's Hospital, on February 13, 2020, I gave a public talk to a group of 50 high school students about suicide prevention. We covered major risk factors for suicide, and how to have a conversation with a loved one if you're concerned about them.

Take-home resources for students included the Conversations Matter guide developed by Everymind and supported by the NSW Mental Health Commission. <a href="http://www.conversationsmatter.com.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=2342">Download the fact sheet here.</a>"
